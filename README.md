  This project consists of 3 different examples:
  <ul>
    <li><b> Project 1 </b>: the system reads temeprature data from LIS3DH and a multiregister read functions. Next, data are sent thorugh an UART module and plotted in bridge control panel</li>
    <li><b>Project 2</b>: the systems read acceleration data on XYZ axis at 100Hz and thourgh a multiregister read function; data are convertend in mg and sent through an UART module. Data are plotted in Bridge Control Panel.
