<b> HW 5 Noemi Gozzi </b>
<p> <h4> Requirements: </h4> 
  Version: <i> PSoC Creator 4.3 </i> 
  
  Board: PSoC 5LP (CY8C5888LTI-LP097) <a href="https://www.cypress.com/products/psoc-creator-integrated-design-environment-ide"> [<i>PSoC Creator</i>] </a>
  
  Additional Hardware: LIS3DH breakout board <a href="https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/085/846/original/lis3dh.pdf?1576396666"> [<i>LIS3DH datasheet</i>] </a>

  This project consists of 3 different examples:
  <ul>
    <li><b> Project 1 </b>: the system reads temperature data from LIS3DH and a multiregister read functions. Next, data are sent thorugh an UART module and plotted in bridge control panel</li>
    <li><b>Project 2</b>: the system reads acceleration data on XYZ axis in normal mode at 100Hz and thourgh a multiregister read function; data are convertend in mg and sent through an UART module. Data are plotted in Bridge Control Panel. 
   </li>
  <li><b>Project 3</b>: the system reads acceleration data on XYZ axis at 100Hz in HIGH resolution mode and through a multiregister read function; data are convertend in m/s with information of 3 decimals and sent through an UART module. Data are plotted in Bridge Control Panel </li>
  </ul>
